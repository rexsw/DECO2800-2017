/**
 * Abstract class for items in the game. Items are to be only equippable/usable on Commander (i.e. the hero units).
 * Items will have 3 types, Weapon, Armour and Special (as indicated in enumerates). Attack and Armour items are passive
 * in nature and would affect at most 3 stats each (excluding effects that are simply stat changes e.g. igniting enemies
 * on physical contact). Special items will be similar to skills in that their effects could be anything but they are 
 * activated when the player chooses to. Special items are also single use i.e. once used, the item will not come back 
 * and the player will need to make another one if they want another one.
 * 
 * 1 Commander can have at most 1 Attack item and 1 Armour item. But Commander can have as many Special items as 
 * the total capacity of the Hero Spacman's inventory.
 * 
 * Items will also have levels i.e. they are upgradeable at the cost of resources. High levels will proportionally 
 * increase the stat changes of the items. Costs of upgrades will also proportionally increase. The max level an item 
 * can have is 3. Item levels start at 1.
